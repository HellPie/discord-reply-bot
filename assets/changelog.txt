So, update `3.4` was released a while ago, but it only contained changes that were not visible to the end users.
I thought adding the changelog for it would have been better, but I don't like to stay silent, so here it is.

Changes since **`3.3`**
- Prepared for Hime 5.0 (Rikka).
- Implemented PM2 process manager ecosystem file for automated restarts and crash recovery.
- Add back silent error catching whenever something goes wrong to handle exceptions within the bot.

Changes since **`3.4`**
- Enable `log` command to DM/PM users whenever possible.
- Added `hackermode` command, locked to users within the `ADORABLE_USERS` list.
